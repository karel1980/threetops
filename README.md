# Threetops

This project aims to provide fun stuff related to the game 'Threes'

# 1+2=3 vs 3+5=8

I like 3+5=8 better because 8 * powers-of-2 is more recognisable than 3 * powers-of-2.

# Ideas

- A html-only threes UI
- An AI threes player (I really don't have an optimal strategy so I thinking neural network or entropica based)
